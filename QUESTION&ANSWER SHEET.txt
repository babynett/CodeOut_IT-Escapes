Final Message: (1)Y0U D1D IT! (2)YOU FOUND ME!!! It is (3)TRUE that I have been hiding for so long within the premises of the place you are in right now. I could not escape it. It has been
calling out to me (4)355 times. I'm scared I might bump into Henry Bowers. That demon almost killed (5)BEN! (6)False...false..true...false..this world has been lying to me! Never mind.
You might be wondering why the code (7) 732202. Because that is the date today, 02/27/2023! Pennywise kept me for so long so I counted every day and did some math while it was gone looking
for food. Addition...(8) Multiplication...Subtraction...I got bored and drank (8)tea because it was the only thing I have. It is now the (9) 170th day since I was last captured on 
September 10. (10)I wanna go home so hurry up. My (10)faith is losing so can you help me and guess what (10)room I'm in? :(
